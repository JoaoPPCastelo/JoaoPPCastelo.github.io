OlÃ¡ ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o, a portuguese guy living in Lisbon and a computer science enthusiast passionate about technology and its applications.

I pursued my studies in computer science at [University of Algarve](https://www.ualg.pt/en), Portugal, where i aqquired a solid foundation in programming languages, cloud computing and a networking. This knowledge has been pivotal in my professional endeavors and continues to inspire me in my work.

On my professional life, i've started as a IT consultant on really cool projects that allowed me to apply what i've learned but also expand my knowledge on programming languages, problem solving, software and cloud architecture, (and more), learning with the amazing professionals that i had the pleasure to meet during my carreer. Currently i'm working as a platform engineer, managing the current infrastructure on AWS, supporting multiple teams on taking the best use of the AWS services and more. 

Beyond my professional life, (yes, life is not just work), I am passionate about photography, music, movies, traveling, spending a nice time with family and friends, doing some exercise at the gym and a few more.

I am always open to connecting with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me via [e-mail](mailto:joaocastelo.dev@outlook.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/joaoppcastelo/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joaoppcastelo), and let's connect!

Thank you for stopping by!
